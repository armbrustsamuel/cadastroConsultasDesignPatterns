# Cadastro de Consultas

## Project
Unisinos says: Do stuff, but please use at least four design patterns

### Singleton
Singleton was implemented in the medical consultation. It will be a unique object up to the end of the consultation.

### Observer
Observer has been implemented to check when any new exam is added to the medical consultation. 

### Factory
Factory was implemented to create doctors and patients. Both are enhanced from a common People class. 

### Facade
Facade has been implemented to set the exam processing. When exam processing has been completed, it changes the status to `done`.
